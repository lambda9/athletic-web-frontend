# Athletics Website Frontend

Website for athletics gym jodhpur developed using ReactJs. It will contain admin panel.

## Requirements

For development we need only Node.js installed on your environment, and please use VSCode and
Prettier Extension. And follow [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/lambda9/athletic-web-frontend/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Node.js Installation

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
npm will also be installed a package manager.

You will be able to run following commands after installing node.

```bash
$ node --version
```

```bash
$ npm --version
```

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lambda9/athletic-web-frontend.git

$ cd athletic-web-frontend

$ npm install
```

## Setting Up Images

All Images used by our project during development are not tracked on **git** so we have to download [Images.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15yt1hgyv09BtInrSWVAPmh8PCM6owWZv/view?usp=sharing)
and extract it into following directory

`athletic-web-frontend/src/`

A folder named **Images** will be created in above directory after extracting and now we are
ready to roll.

## Start

```bash
$ npm start
```
Now just open <a href="https:localhost:3000/">this</a>

## Viewing our app on devices conneted to your network.

We can also run our react app on other devices connected to your wifi, most importantaly you want to run it on
your phone so you can see how it looks in your phone, and make it much better experience for phone users as our ui
should also look good in our phones and **phone screens should be our first priority**.

You can refer to this [guide](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-view-your-react-app-on-a-mobile-device-697e248afddd)

First you should find out your IPV4 address of your hotspot, you can get this from your wifi settings.
then enter the following url in your phone.

```
http://[IPV4 address]:3000/
```
